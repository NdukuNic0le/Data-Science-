This repository contains a collection of Jupyter notebooks that demonstrate the fundamentals of machine learning and deep learning in Python. The notebooks use popular libraries such as Sklearn, Keras, and TensorFlow to solve a variety of problems, including classification, regression, and clustering. Each notebook includes detailed explanations of the algorithms used, as well as code examples and visualizations.
I used the notebooks to practise and build my machine learning and deep learning skills locally, these are by no means production ready scripts and do not include sensitive information such as API keys.
